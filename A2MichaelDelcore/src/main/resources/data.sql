	('In the Tall Grass', 'A straight to Netflix thriller movie based off a Stephen King novel, In the Tall Grass 
		was an edge-of-your-seat movie that keeps you guessing as to what will happen next. It is the movie version 
		of a rollercoaster that spins you around and around, and each time you look up the world looks 
		more and more distorted. Not the greatest movie ever, but a fun watch nonetheless.', '2020-10-14', '08:12'),
	('Bloodshot', 'Available on Amazon Prime, Bloodshot is the kind of movie full of action like an old school action movie, 
		but minus any decent storytelling. It is worth watching if you are in it 
		for some dumb fun, but nothing that will amaze you. Non-stop action with little room 
		for any story, if that is what you like then this is the movie for you!', '2020-10-14', '12:14'),
	('Onward', 'A beautifully animated Pixar movie, Onward has plenty of charm for 
		viewers young and old alike. Not quite the best movie from Pixar, but still 
		an amazing movie worth seeing.', '2020-10-15', '01:45');
